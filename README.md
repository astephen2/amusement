amusement is a Python package and CLI (command-line interface) to get the current wait times and show times of attractions at many popular theme parks. These are the official times straight from the official mobile apps of the respective parks. No unreliable crowdsouring required! We currently support:

* All Disney parks in USA
* All Universal parks worldwide (with the exception of Singapore)
* Hersheypark

## Example
### CLI
Get wait times right from your terminal
```
amusement islands-adventure --type rides
```

### Library
```
from amusement.parks.universal.IslandsOfAdventure import IslandsOfAdventure

ioa = IslandsOfAdventure()
print ioa.rides()
# or print ioa.shows() if you want show times instead
```
A full list of the rides and shows in the park will be displayed!

## Getting Started
```
pip install amusement
```
That's it!
